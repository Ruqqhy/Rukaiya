Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to explore patterns in passenger survival and develop a predictive model. It applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to identify key factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

📁 Project Overview
The Titanic disaster of 1912 is one of the most well-known maritime tragedies in history. This dataset, made available through Kaggle's Titanic competition, provides detailed information on passengers such as age, sex, class, and fare. The goal is to use this data to:

Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis

Identify patterns and relationships between features

Build a predictive model to determine survival outcomes

🔍 Objectives
Improve data exploration and visualization skills

Gain insights into real-world classification problems

Train and evaluate machine learning models on structured data

Communicate findings clearly and effectively

📊 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning and model evaluation

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

📈 Key Findings

Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males.

Passengers in first class were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.

Age and fare were moderately correlated with survival.

🤖 Model Performance
A logistic regression  were trained and evaluated using accuracy and precision metrics. The  model achieved an accuracy of approximately 79% on the data provided.
